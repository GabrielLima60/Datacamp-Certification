# Datacamp-Certification
This is the data scientist associate practical exam from datacamp

The exam gives you a dataset of moped reviews and asks you to do data validation, exploratory analysis, model fitting and model evaluation with machine learning in order to predict which reviews come from people who have never owned the moped before.
